	<h1>About me</h1>
	<p>
		I grew up in Osaka, studied foreign languages, and specialized in Spanish. Fell in love with Mexico when I was an exchange student, and have been living in Mexico City for the last five years.

		Worked in the tourism field for five years, that's why I know a lot about Mexico's history and its great culture.

		Now I work as a Web Developer and spend most of my free time illustrating lonely people in the streets of Mexico City.</p>
